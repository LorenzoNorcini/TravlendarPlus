//  This is the event model. It contains a main struct Event which is used for
//  the coding/decoding of the json to send to or receive from the server.
//  This structure contains all the event-related information, included the optional
//  associated travel option.
//
//  It also takes into account the current event selected in the DayViewController and
//  the list of associated travels.
